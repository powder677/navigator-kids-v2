            <div class="qa-block" id="what-is-iep">
                <h3>What is an IEP?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a legally binding document that outlines special education services, goals, and accommodations for a child with a disability. Schools must follow it exactly.</p>

                <h3>How do I request a special education evaluation?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Write a letter to your school principal stating: "I am requesting a comprehensive evaluation for my child to determine eligibility for special education services." Keep a copy and send it certified mail.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between an IEP and a 504 Plan?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An IEP provides specialized instruction and services for a child with a disability. A 504 Plan only provides accommodations (like extra time) to ensure access to the learning environment, but no specialized instruction.</p>
                <a href="/resources/iep-vs-504/">Read full comparison →</a>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is FAPE?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> FAPE stands for "Free Appropriate Public Education." It is the legal right of every student with a disability to receive an education that meets their unique needs at no cost to parents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Can I record an IEP meeting?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It depends on your state laws. Many states allow it if you notify the school in advance. Recording is highly recommended to ensure an accurate record of what was promised.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is Prior Written Notice (PWN)?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> PWN is a document the school must give you whenever they propose or refuse to change your child's identification, evaluation, or placement. It must explain <em>why</em> they made the decision.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>How often is an IEP reviewed?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An IEP must be reviewed at least once every 12 months (Annual Review). However, you can request a meeting to review and revise the IEP at any time if issues arise.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What are "Procedural Safeguards"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a document explaining your legal rights under IDEA law, including your right to participate in meetings, examine records, and dispute decisions. Schools must give this to you at least once a year.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Who is required to attend an IEP meeting?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The team must include: the parent, a general ed teacher, a special ed teacher, a district representative (who can approve resources), and someone who can interpret evaluation results.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is the "Stay Put" provision?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> "Stay Put" keeps your child in their current educational placement and services while a dispute is being resolved. The school cannot change the placement without your agreement during this time.</p>

            <h2>Meltdowns & Emotional Regulation</h2>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is the difference between a meltdown and a tantrum?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A tantrum is goal-directed behavior that stops when the child gets what they want. A meltdown is a nervous system overload—the child has lost access to their thinking brain and cannot stop even if they wanted to.</p>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is "Restraint Collapse"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This occurs when a child masks their struggles at school to "hold it together," only to fall apart immediately upon getting home to their safe space. It is a sign of high anxiety and masking.</p>
                <a href="/resources/restraint-collapse/">Learn more →</a>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>How long does a meltdown last?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A meltdown can last anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. It ends when the nervous system stabilizes, not because a demand was met. The recovery phase often involves exhaustion or shame.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Should I punish a meltdown?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. Punishing a meltdown is like punishing a seizure; it is involuntary. Punishment increases anxiety and makes future meltdowns more likely. Focus on safety first, then connection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is Co-Regulation?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Co-regulation is sharing your calm nervous system with a dysregulated child. By staying calm, breathing deeply, and using a soft voice, you help their brain signal safety and return to baseline.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What are common sensory triggers?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Common triggers include fluorescent lights, loud cafeteria noise, "scratchy" clothing tags, strong smells, or unexpected touch. These inputs can overwhelm a sensitive nervous system.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>How do I handle a public meltdown?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Prioritize your child's safety over stranger's opinions. Reduce sensory input (leave the store), use minimal language, and stay close. Do not try to reason or teach a lesson until you are home and calm.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is the "Thinking Brain"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This refers to the Prefrontal Cortex, responsible for logic and reasoning. During a meltdown, this part of the brain goes "offline," which is why you cannot reason with a child in distress.</p>

        <section id="twice-exceptional">
            <h2>Understanding Twice-Exceptional (2e)</h2>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What does "twice-exceptional" (2e) mean?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Twice-exceptional (2e) refers to students who are both gifted (high cognitive ability) and have a disability (like ADHD, Autism, or Dyslexia). They often require a unique mix of advanced coursework and remedial support.</p>
                <a href="/resources/what-is-2e/">Full definition →</a>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Is my child gifted if they have bad grades?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Giftedness is a measure of cognitive potential, not academic performance. Many 2e children have average or failing grades because their disability prevents them from demonstrating their knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Can you have ADHD and be gifted?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. High intelligence does not protect against executive function deficits. In fact, high intelligence can often mask ADHD symptoms until the academic demands exceed the child's ability to compensate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is Asynchronous Development?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This describes uneven development where a child may have the intellect of a 12-year-old, the physical coordination of an 8-year-old, and the emotional regulation of a 4-year-old.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is "Stealth Dyslexia"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This occurs when highly intelligent children use advanced reasoning to compensate for reading difficulties. They may comprehend text well but struggle significantly with spelling and decoding.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Why do 2e kids struggle socially?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2e kids often relate better to older children or adults due to their advanced vocabulary, but may lack the emotional maturity to navigate peer conflicts, leading to isolation.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Do 2e kids need special education?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Often, yes. If their disability impacts their ability to access the curriculum (even if they are passing), they may qualify for an IEP to provide support for their deficits while enriching their strengths.</p>

            <h2>Parent Advocacy</h2>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Do I need an educational advocate?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You might if your school is denying evaluations, refusing services, or if communication has broken down. An advocate knows the law and can help remove emotions from the negotiation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What if the school says "we don't see that behavior here"?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This usually means your child is masking. Request a functional behavior assessment (FBA) and ask the school to document what happens <em>before</em> (antecedent) and <em>after</em> (consequence) any minor incidents.</p>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>How do I organize my IEP binder?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use a 3-ring binder with tabs for: Current IEP, Evaluations, Progress Reports, Communication Log, and Work Samples. Keep the most recent documents on top for quick access during meetings.</p>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>What is the "Wait to Fail" model?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a reactive approach where schools refuse to intervene until a child has fallen significantly behind. Parents should advocate for "Response to Intervention" (RTI) or immediate evaluation rather than waiting.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div class="qa-block">
                <h3>Can I email the teacher every day?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> While allowed, it is not recommended as it can damage the relationship. Instead, request a "Daily Communication Log" (a simple checklist) in the IEP to get daily updates without sending constant emails.</p>
